# Compiler Optimisation

This repository holds the work I did for the Compiler Optimisation course during my Msc at the University of Edinburgh. 

I used a genetic algorithm to search for optimal compiler flags across a range of benchmarks

## Scripts

The scripts required to run the genetic algorithm on the Cirrus compute cluster.

## Results

Data from running benchmarks

## Doc

The final report I submitted on this work.

## coptbenchmarks2013

The benchmarks themselves
